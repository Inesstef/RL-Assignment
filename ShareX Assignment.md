# Combine and align images

## Take advantage of the new feature where images can now be aligned left, right, and center when combined into one

## Learn the difference between using green check mark to save changes and the Save icon

The Image combiner tool was available before, but it wasn’t possible to align
added images differently, there was only center alignment. Use the *Image
combiner* tool (located in the Tools submenu on the left) and add images to the
frame by clicking the *Add* button or drag and dropping them into the frame.

Use the *Move up* and *Move down* buttons to arrange the order of the images. It
is also possible to move them up and down in the frame itself by drag and
dropping them inside of it. From the *Combine orientation* dropdown list select
whether the images will be arranged vertically or horizontally. The *Image
alignment* dropdown list enables top, right, or left alignment, depending on the
wanted output. The Space between images is calculated in pixels and can be
entered either by using up and down arrow buttons, or manually (typing it in the
box). After arranging the images and the wanted output, click the bottom button
– *Combine images and save/upload depending on after capture settings*. The
application will display the combined images as one. Depending on the personal
settings, the image will either get saved automatically or will require
confirmation that the output is ok. If it requires confirmation, click either
the green check mark or the Save icon in the heading bar to save the changes.

## Checking after capture settings

If not sure where the settings for the required action after image capture are,
follow these instructions.

1.  Select the *After capture tasks* menu item on the left

1.  Check which of the available actions are bold. Those are currently turned
    on.

2.  If *Open in image editor* is bold, that means the image will first open in
    the editor and will not be automatically saved but will require confirmation
    that you want to save it. To save it, you can either confirm by clicking the
    green check mark or click the Save or Save as icons. The difference between
    the green check mark and Save icons is that the check mark signifies all the
    selected *After capture tasks* (items in bold in the menu) will be run after
    you click it.

Save icons will only perform the selected save function. If we take the image
above as an example, clicking the green check mark will run the following tasks:

-   Open in image editor

-   Copy image to clipboard

-   Save image to file

-   Copy file to clipboard

-   Upload image to host

Depending on the actions you want to perform after capturing/creating an image,
select or unselect menu items as often as required.
